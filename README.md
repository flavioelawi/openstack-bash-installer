This is my attempt to create a bash script to ease the installation process, it should configure top-down a working openstack node or nodes.
I'm expecting it to be able to install new nodes via ssh.

ONLY TESTED ON UBUNTU 14.04 LTS

TODO
SSH remote install
Multinode intelligent setup

TO LAUNCH:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/galiral/openstack-bash-installer.git
chmod +x openstack-bash-installer.sh
./openstack-bash-installer.sh
```
