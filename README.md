This is my attempt to create a bash script to ease the installation process, it should configure top-down a working openstack node or nodes.
I'm expecting it to be able to install new nodes via ssh.

TODO
SSH remote install

TO LAUNCH:

git clone https://github.com/galiral/openstack-bash-installer.git
chmod +x openstack-bash-installer.sh
./openstack-bash-installer.sh
